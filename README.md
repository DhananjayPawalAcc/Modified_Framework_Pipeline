# Multi-Source Model Processing Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to handle multiple video sources and models for **object detection**, **segmentation**, and **classification** tasks. It supports a variety of video input sources such as **webcam**, **YouTube URLs**, **video files**, and other **URLs**. The pipeline operates with separate threads for each source for efficient parallel processing, while the **visualizer** runs on the main thread for all sources.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Multiple Source Support**: Input sources can be **webcam**, **video files**, **URLs**, or **YouTube URLs**.
- **Model Flexibility**: Currently supports **YOLO detection**, **segmentation**, and **classification models**.
- **Multithreading**: Each video source runs in its own thread, enabling parallel processing.
- **Centralized Visualization**: Visualization tasks are handled in the main thread for all sources.
- **Easy Configuration**: Minimal changes are needed to configure the pipeline for new models or sources.

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 (or any compatible detection, segmentation, or classification model)
- Requests (for YouTube URLs)

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
